## MQTT Agent and Demo Tasks - Using coreMQTT

Note:  The MQTT agent and associated example project are functional but not yet complete. Be aware the agent does not yet comply with our code quality standards and is not yet fully tested. There is a chance its APIs will change before its official first release.  Feedback, suggestions and comments are welcom on the [FreeRTOS support forum](https://forums.freertos.org).

[coreMQTT](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/coreMQTT) is an MIT licensed open source C MQTT client library for microcontrollers and small microprocessor based IoT devices. Itâ€™s design is intentionally simple to ensure it has no dependency on any other library or operating system, and to better enable static analysis including [memory safety proofs](https://www.freertos.org/2020/02/ensuring-the-memory-safety-of-freertos-part-1.html). That simplicity and lack of operating system dependency (coreMQTT does not require multithreading at all) means coreMQTT does not build thread safety directly into its implementation. Instead thread safety must be provided by higher level software. This labs project implements a coreMQTT extension that provides that higher level functionality in the form of an MQTT agent (or MQTT daemon). While the implementation demonstrated here is currently specific to FreeRTOS, there are not many dependencies on FreeRTOS, meaning the implementation can easily be adapted for use with other operating systems.

The [documentation page](https://freertos.org/mqtt/mqtt-agent-demo.html) for this repository contains information on the agent and the contained demo project.
